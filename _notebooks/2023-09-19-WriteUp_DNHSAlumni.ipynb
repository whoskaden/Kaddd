    "- Organization and having some sort of plan will make a big difference in finding a job from employers \n",
    "- Find something that your actually passionate about and actually enjoy like making a app or website and it doesn't have to be something that would change the world but could just be something stupid and fun \n",
    "- Leet Code is possibly the most important factor in getting considered for a job, since it helps you practice algorithms + code \n",
    "\n",

    "## Reflection \n",
    "\n",
    "After taking some insights from the DNHS alumnis who have gone through multiple expierences like college, internships, interviews, and just have a better general knowledge of CS, I've learned a lot and honestly some questions I've had even if they were small were answered when I was listening to the panel which I feel is pretty cool and important. My key takeways include recognizing the very competitive nature in CS and potential advantages of pursuing a specialized niche, which I hadn't really thought about which I thought was cool. Another equally important takeaway is the emphasis on extracurricular involvment, especially roles like teaching or hands on projects like web development, and it won't only let me practice my skill set but also lets me put something on my resume and I'll definitely be trying to do something like this. I also felt like the \"Kool Aid Cheat Code\" part of the panel was pretty interesting and important since it showed me the significance of utilizing different tools to showcase your projects/make them like Vercel, Svelte Kit, Flash, or the importance of making a personal website as a project to showcase your skill to employers. All in all, I'll be keeping these takeaways in mind for a lot of things like future internships, college apps, or interviews for jobs and I feel like I learned a lot from this panel. "
